# GryEngine

A C++ game engine developed as a hobby :)
This project is ongoing, and it's primary purpose is C++ / Game Engine Design practice.
Originally started as a tinker project off of github using SDL2 to try and render some 2D objects,
but decided that if I'm going to work on an engine I may as well commit (that's a github joke lol).
So I decided to start again and go for the full OpenGL works.
